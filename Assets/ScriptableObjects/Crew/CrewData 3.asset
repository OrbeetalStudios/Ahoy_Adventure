  ability: Ammo
  bio: A pirate's life can be frightening in some situations, so Spritz always tries
    to be prescient. His anxiety and foresight do not help him relax on the ship,
    but they certainly make him more alert and prepared than others. She was given
    her name to refer back to the drink she is used to consuming to try to keep her
    fears under control.
